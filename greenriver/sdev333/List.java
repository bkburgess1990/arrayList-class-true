/**
 * <p>A list is a collection where the order of the items is controlled
 * by the client that uses this interface. The client can access items
 * by their integer index (position in the list), and search for items
 * in the list.</p>
 *
 * <p>Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based.</p>
 *
 * <p>Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements.</p>
 *
 * <p>The List interface provides methods for position-based (indexed) access
 * to list items.</p>
 *
 * <p>The List interface provides methods for modification of the list
 * (add and remove) at a given position (index).</p>
 *
 * <p>The List interface provides two methods to search for a specified item.
 * Warning: the performance of these operations are dependent on the
 * implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>In addition to providing an Iterator (as required by Collection),
 * the List interface provides a special iterator, called a ListIterator
 * that allows element insertion and replacement, and bidirectional access
 * in addition to the normal operations that Iterator provides.</p>
